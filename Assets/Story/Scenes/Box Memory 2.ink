A lanky kid with coal coloured hair runs down the rooftop garden path, hair blowing in the city breeze. A burly man in his late 30's, a furrowed brow and a big brown beard looks up from his work, his expression lightening as he sees the approaching child. 
"Dad! Dad! Mag's family invited all of us to dinner tonight!"
In his excited as the boy runs, he trips over a hoe left lying across the garden path. Before he can hit the ground, a strong pair of arms catch him. 
"Careful now Kai, can't eat dinner if you break all your teeth can you now?"
Kai smiles sheepishly, looking around at the rows upon rows of vegetables grown atop the building.
"Are you going to come Dad?"
The furrow returns to the bearded manâ€™s brow. He scratches his arm, looking towards the empty crates to be filled and further beyond to Stemon Industries where the strikes continue for its 13th month. 
"I'll see what I can do Kai, run along now to Dad now."
