Across the other side of the tent a picture of a manically grinning carnival master is pinned to a wooden board and embedded with several knives that have been thrown into it.","\n","^An older girl pushes the tent flaps apart, around 16 of age and wearing several layers of elaborate sparkling make-up and the same-coloured black hair as the child.","\n","^“There you are, I’ve been looking all over for you.”","\n","^She bends down next to the child, putting her hands on them protectively, though the child does not respond or stop their weeping.","\n","^A sad smile breaks across her face, and she begins to gently stroke their hair.","\n","^“I know little Raven, I know.”","\n","^Tears still running down their face, the child looks up to their sister.","\n","^“Why do you have to leave me alone?”","\n","^She breaks from their gaze, looking back towards the tent flap.","\n","^“I…I can’t say. Its my fault. I’m sorry.”","\n","^Turning back, she pulls out a golden locket engraved with a ravens skull on it, inside a picture of the two of them laughing and smiling as they balance atop a metal pole, she pushes it into the child’s hand.","\n","^“If you hold this tight, I will watch over you little Raven.”","\n",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
