Blood splatters across the concrete of the rooftop, follow by the thud of an armoured body hitting the ground. Standing, panting, their fists raised, is a tall man in all black. Bandana covering their face, a blood-stained gold locket wrapped around their wrist, and spiked knuckledusters clutched in their fists, they suddenly drop to the ground in gasp, as the adrenaline fades. 
As a victorious cheer echoes up the streets, sun beaming out across the city rooftops and a chorus of birds crying out as if to join the people in their joy, a smile creeps across the fallen man’s cracked lips. 
“We did it…we fucking did it, we fucking WON!”
He leaps up with joy, only to immediately collapse against as his exhausted legs give out, falling with a groan. Chuckling at himself, he opens his eyes to meet the stem of a small leafy plant growing from a crack in the rooftop. 
Without knowing why, the smile drops from his face as he sees a small green caterpillar clinging to the stem, moving rapidly as it weaves itself a cocoon. 
Sitting up suddenly, he begins to look around, looking for something, anything wrong. Then the bird’s crying no longer sounds like cries of joy, they sound like screams of warning. 
The sky turns red, ringing drowns his ears, the ground shakes, and darkness takes the world.
