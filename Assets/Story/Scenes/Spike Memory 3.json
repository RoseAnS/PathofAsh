Standing, panting, their fists raised, is a tall man in all black. Bandana covering their face, a blood-stained gold locket wrapped around their wrist, and spiked knuckledusters clutched in their fists, they suddenly drop to the ground in gasp, as the adrenaline fades.","\n","^As a victorious cheer echoes up the streets, sun beaming out across the city rooftops and a chorus of birds crying out as if to join the people in their joy, a smile creeps across the fallen man’s cracked lips.","\n","^“We did it…we fucking did it, we fucking WON!”","\n","^He leaps up with joy, only to immediately collapse against as his exhausted legs give out, falling with a groan. Chuckling at himself, he opens his eyes to meet the stem of a small leafy plant growing from a crack in the rooftop.","\n","^Without knowing why, the smile drops from his face as he sees a small green caterpillar clinging to the stem, moving rapidly as it weaves itself a cocoon.","\n","^Sitting up suddenly, he begins to look around, looking for something, anything wrong. Then the bird’s crying no longer sounds like cries of joy, they sound like screams of warning.","\n","^The sky turns red, ringing drowns his ears, the ground shakes, and darkness takes the world.","\n",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
