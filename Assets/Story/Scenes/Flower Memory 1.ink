Lying in the soft meadow grass of the estate, the summer sun reflecting of the bracelet of multicoloured beads around their wrist, a child of no age greater than  8 lies  on their stomach unmoving. Staring with wide and unblinking eyes at a fluffy golden honeybee nestling in the flowers of a lavender whorl.

They look with wonder  as the little antenna bob up and down busily  as it collects the sweet nectar of the flower. Then, as it drinks the last drop, it flies away.  

In a sudden flurry of movement, the child unleashes the pencil they had been clutching onto a blank page of  a dark green sketchbook,  beads clicking as the bracelet sways with each line drawn, capturing the image of the honeybee almost perfectly.

As the child puts down their pencil and smiles with glee as they look at their work,  the disappears  as a tall dark  shadow looms over them, dark  brown eyes dissecting the child's drawing with biologica l precision. 

"The antenna are too elongated, and the eyes are unproportional . Do it again, properly."
